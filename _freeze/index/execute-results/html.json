From 2016-2020, the data was wrangled into three subsets, one for each cycle. To simplify the analysis, all parties that are outside of Republican and Democrat were grouped into a new generalized party called \"Other\". These subsets were then displayed on a US map, where the fill of the state indicates which party has the house majority, while the label of the state indicates which party had the popular vote majority. This revealed insights into how the electoral system can lead to politicians that may not represent the sentiment of the population of the state. Zooming in on the state of Arizona, voting trends were analyzed over a longer time frame of 10 years, from 2012 to 2022. The mode of voting as well as the change in party in each district was visualized to create insights into how mode of voting will influence the winning candidate, and how that influences the winning party in each district.\n\nInsights into voting trends are very important metrics for politicians and the general population as it can be directly be related to other aspects of life such as the economy and global politics. These insights can then help politicians target states where voter sentiment can make or break a politicians campaign.\n\nThe analysis focused on time-series analysis as the variables were view over time and the changes noted as valuable insights. The limitations for this project include the assumption that the conglomeration of minor parties will create a larger third party that will vote different from Democrat and Republican, though this is not the case in real life, where some minor parties will align closer to the larger parties and some will votes on their own ideas. Ulitmately, This study provides insights into US voting patterns and the impact of election results on future voting trends.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Introduction\n\n## Introducing the Dataset\n\nThe dataset, [US House Election Results](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-11-07) is sourced from MIT Election Data and Science Lab (MEDSL), offers a comprehensive overview of US House elections.\n\nThis dataset contains observations for elections held over 47 years from 1976 to 2022, encompassing a total of 32,452 recorded events. Each event is represented as a row with 20 attributes as columns. These columns provide details including the year, state, district, political party, candidate's name, votes received, and various indicators such as whether it was a runoff election or if it was a write-in candidate. In the US, the House of Representatives are elected in districts in each state. The number of districts in a state is representative of the population of a state.\n\n## EDA\n\nSummary Statistics for Dataset\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nSummary Statistics for year :\n   Min. 1st Qu.

To answer this question, district majority (the number of districts a party won), and party vote majority (the number of votes a party received overall), will be visualized. The data will be narrowed down to the district, party, candidate votes and state for the years 2016, 2018, and 2020. The interest in this question stems from the recent volatility in the US political climate and to understand how voter sentiment changed in the last presidential cycle. Data from the House of Representatives is used rather than general election data because it gives insight into voter sentiment every two years and is more of a direct reflection of voters' beliefs since there are more candidates that can be elected.\n\n## Approach\nElection data from 2016, 2018, and 2020 were extracted from the data set. To quantify party majority metrics in a more simplified manner, all parties that are outside of Republican and Democrat were grouped into a new generalized party called \"Other\". For each year of interest, a map of the USA is plotted with all 50 states, where the color of the fill and the color of the label of each state represent different voting metrics. The fill of each state is based on which party has the most districts, which is called \"House Majority\". The color of the label of each state is based on which party has the most votes overall, called \"Popular Vote Majority\". The three maps will then be set in a tabbed format, which will allow years to be toggled between. Maps are useful to analyze this question because they show state-wise data in an accessible way. The colors are then mapped to each party's traditional color, which makes for an easy way to correlate the colors to a party. \n\n## Analysis\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## 2016\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=1536}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## 2018\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=1536}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 2020\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=1536}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe visualization of the House of Representatives broken down by district majority and popular vote majority provides multiple insights. \n\n1) The sentiment of the general population is often overlooked by the electoral (district) system.\n  This is evident in the fact that the color of the state differs from the color of the label. This is due to the fact that some districts will have different population concentrations, so when one district    might have a large population and votes for one party and two other districts with less than 1/2 the population each vote for the opposite party, the district majority will favor the second and third example districts and the popular vote will favor the first more populous district.\n  \n2) During a single presidency, the sentiment of the people will change significantly.\n  In the 2018 plot, the house majority changes to Democrat for 49 of the 50 states. This is a well known trend that is typical of most presidencies where the House of Representatives will flip to the opposite party of the president in the midterm elections. It is reasonable to assume that if 2022 is analyzed, it would show a more red map with the house majority becoming Republican since it is the opposite party of the presidency currently in office in 2022.\n\n3) Some states show no change with each feature.\n  States on the west coast show no change in popular vote or house majority. Other states like Texas, see the House majority change over the time frame, but the popular vote majority stays the same way. This reveals that state as a population supports one party, while the district system will elect a different one based on how the districts are created. \n\n\n\n\n# Question 2 : How often did change occur in House representation from the years 2012-2022 in the state of Arizona and which voting methods played a significant role in these elections?\n\n## Introduction.\n\nThis question seeks to achieve two objectives: firstly, to identify recurring patterns in Arizona's House representation, and secondly, to examine the impact of different voting methods on election outcomes. We have utilized comprehensive data on House elections in Arizona spanning from 2012 to 2022 to answer this question. This dataset contains details regarding the voting methods employed, election results, party affiliations, districts, and the total votes garnered by each candidate. Through scrutinizing fluctuations in House representation, we aim to gain deeper insights into Arizona's political landscape. Simultaneously, analyzing voting techniques allows us to assess the fairness of elections and devise strategies to increase voter participation.\n\n## Approach\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Analysis\n\n<<<<<<< HEAD\nThe analysis will look at election results from 2012, 2016, and 2022 to see how Arizona's congressional district alignments have changed over time. The goal is to identify patterns of political representation inside the state's districts, detecting movements in party control over both short-term and decade-long periods. Furthermore, the analysis will look into the influence of various voting procedures, specifically their impact on election outcomes in Arizona.\n\n## Arizona Congressional District Maps\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## 2012\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/2012 District Map-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 2016\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/2016 District Map-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 2022\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/2022 District Map-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n<<<<<<< HEAD\nThe resultant visualization is a color-coded map of Arizona's congressional districts in 2012, based on the political party that won each seat.

This localisation reveals the political leaning of most of the congressional districts in Arizona during that election cycle was towards the Democratic party. One key feature of the 2016 and 2022 visualizations is the use of transparency to highlight shifts in political representations. Districts with a party change are displayed with a lower opacity, distinguishing them from those with no change, which keep full-color saturation. The 2016 visualization reveals that the political leaning of 6th congressional district has changed from Democratic party to Republican party.The 2022 visualization reveals that the political leaning of 1st and 9th districts has changed from Democratic party to Republican party. Additionally, 4th congressional district has changed from Republican party to Democratic party.\n=======\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    :::\n\n>>>>>>> f2c9b4ccef533d148e75285d35ccbd68e077f8bc\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/Data Visualization Q.2-1.png){width=1536}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe resultant visualisation is a color-coded map of Arizona's congressional districts in 2012, based on the political party that won each seat.

This consistency points strong party loyalty at these times. But a decade of observation tells a different story: there are notable changes in party representation in different districts. This discovery highlights a slow but significant shift in voter attitude and party affiliations. Even though it is rare for districts to switch parties in the course of one or two election cycles, a ten-year period shows a dynamic and ever-changing political landscape. This long-term perspective on the ups and downs of political change allows for a better understanding of the complexity and gradual alterations in voter preferences and party power.\n\n# ANY CODE BELOW THIS SECTION ADD TO THE ABOVE SECTIONS\n\n\nAnalyzing and filtering Arizona's vote data from 2012 to 2022, brings emphasis on the various methods of voting and how it effects the outcomes of candidates. By focusing on particular details—year, voting type, and election results—it determines both the frequency and percentage of each vote result. This data allows to visualize the Arizona district electoral evolution over that decade.\n\nThe resultant visualization is a color-coded map of Arizona's congressional districts in 2012, based on the political party that won each seat.

An interesting trend emerges from examining Arizona's congressional district maps: while the political setting remains relatively stable over short periods, such as between elections just a few years apart, a decade-long observation reveals significant changes in party representation across districts, indicating shifts in voter attitudes and party affiliations. The analysis of Arizona's electoral data over the past decade shows varying success rates for conventional voting methods, with a significant decline in 2020 followed by a notable recovery in 2022. In contrast, candidates utilizing write-in approaches consistently faced electoral setbacks year after year. This highlights the ongoing difficulty write-in candidates face in gaining political success in Arizona, despite traditional voting procedures maintaining dominance. These visual representations provide valuable insights into evolving political dynamics and voter preferences within the state.\n",
