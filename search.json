This visualization will clearly depict the political landscape across the states for the selected election year.\n\nFor Question 2:\nVariables Involved:\n\ndistrict: The congressional district number.\nfusion ticket : allowing candidate to receive votes from multiple party.\nrunoff : second election held to determine a winner\nparty: The political party of the candidate.\ncandidatevotes: The number of votes the candidate received.\n\nVariables to be Created:\n\npopulation: This will require merging external data containing population\n\nAnalysis Approach:\n\nMerge External Data: Incorporate population data from a reliable source (e.g. U.S. Census Bureau).\nAnalyze Voting Type by Population: Examine the relationship between population and the predominant type of voting, using statistical analysis.\nCorrelate with Election Outcomes: Assess how the type of voting and population correlate with the election outcomes, focusing on which party tends to loose with certain characteristics.\n\nVisualization and Reporting:\n\nUse scatter plots or heat maps to show the relationship between population and mode of voting.\nCreate comparative visualizations to illustrate how these factors influence election outcomes, potentially using pie charts or bar charts."
