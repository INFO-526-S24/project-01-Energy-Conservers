    "text": "This study explores US House election results from 1976 to 2022, focusing on US House of Representative trends from 2016-2022, and state-wide trends in Arizona from 2012-2022. From 2016-2020, the data was wrangled into three subsets, one for each cycle. To simplify the analysis, all parties that are outside of Republican and Democrat were grouped into a new generalized party called “Other”. These subsets were then displayed on a US map, where the fill of the state indicates which party has the house majority, while the label of the state indicates which party had the popular vote majority. This revealed insights into how the electoral system can lead to politicians that may not represent the sentiment of the population of the state. Zooming in on the state of Arizona, voting trends were analyzed over a longer time frame of 10 years, from 2012 to 2022. The mode of voting as well as the change in party in each district was visualized to create insights into how mode of voting will influence the winning candidate, and how that influences the winning party in each district.\nInsights into voting trends are very important metrics for politicians and the general population as it can be directly be related to other aspects of life such as the economy and global politics. These insights can then help politicians target states where voter sentiment can make or break a politicians campaign.\nThe analysis focused on time-series analysis as the variables were view over time and the changes noted as valuable insights. The limitations for this project include the assumption that the conglomeration of minor parties will create a larger third party that will vote different from Democrat and Republican, though this is not the case in real life, where some minor parties will align closer to the larger parties and some will votes on their own ideas. Ulitmately, This study provides insights into US voting patterns and the impact of election results on future voting trends."

    "text": "Introduction\nThe goal of Q1 is to understand how voting trends in the House of Representatives change over the course of a presidency. To answer this question, district majority (the number of districts a party won), and party vote majority (the number of votes a party received overall), will be visualized. The data will be narrowed down to the district, party, candidate votes and state for the years 2016, 2018, and 2020. The interest in this question stems from the recent volatility in the US political climate and to understand how voter sentiment changed in the last presidential cycle. Data from the House of Representatives is used rather than general election data because it gives insight into voter sentiment every two years and is more of a direct reflection of voters’ beliefs since there are more candidates that can be elected."

To quantify party majority metrics in a more simplified manner, all parties that are outside of Republican and Democrat were grouped into a new generalized party called “Other”. For each year of interest, a map of the USA is plotted with all 50 states, where the color of the fill and the color of the label of each state represent different voting metrics. The fill of each state is based on which party has the most districts, which is called “House Majority”. The color of the label of each state is based on which party has the most votes overall, called “Popular Vote Majority”. The three maps will then be set in a tabbed format, which will allow years to be toggled between. Maps are useful to analyze this question because they show state-wise data in an accessible way. The colors are then mapped to each party’s traditional color, which makes for an easy way to correlate the colors to a party."

    "text": "Discussion\nThe visualization of the House of Representatives broken down by district majority and popular vote majority provides multiple insights.\n\nThe sentiment of the general population is often overlooked by the electoral (district) system. This is evident in the fact that the color of the state differs from the color of the label. This is due to the fact that some districts will have different population concentrations, so when one district might have a large population and votes for one party and two other districts with less than 1/2 the population each vote for the opposite party, the district majority will favor the second and third example districts and the popular vote will favor the first more populous district.\nDuring a single presidency, the sentiment of the people will change significantly. In the 2018 plot, the house majority changes to Democrat for 49 of the 50 states. This is a well known trend that is typical of most presidencies where the House of Representatives will flip to the opposite party of the president in the midterm elections. It is reasonable to assume that if 2022 is analyzed, it would show a more red map with the house majority becoming Republican since it is the opposite party of the presidency currently in office in 2022.\nSome states show no change with each feature. States on the west coast show no change in popular vote or house majority. Other states like Texas, see the House majority change over the time frame, but the popular vote majority stays the same way. This reveals that state as a population supports one party, while the district system will elect a different one based on how the districts are created."

This dataset contains details regarding the voting methods employed, election results, party affiliations, districts, and the total votes garnered by each candidate.

For the second part, the visual representation of the data will distinguish between victories and defeats through color-coded bars and labeled percentages. The objective is to identify patterns of political representation within the state’s districts, detecting movements in party control over both short-term and decade-long periods.

    "text": "Discussion\nThe first visualization is a color-coded map of Arizona’s congressional districts in 2012, based on the political party that won each seat. Each district is assigned a color that represents the winning party blue for Democrats and red for Republicans.The representation offers a visual picture of Arizona’s political distribution in 2012, highlighting regions of Democratic and Republican strength and providing insights into regional political processes. This localisation reveals the political leaning of most of the congressional districts in Arizona during that election cycle was towards the Democratic party. One key feature of the 2016 and 2022 visualizations is the use of transparency to highlight shifts in political representations. Districts with a party change are displayed with a lower opacity, distinguishing them from those with no change, which keep full-color saturation. The 2016 visualization reveals that the political leaning of 2nd congressional district has changed from Democratic party to Republican party. The 2022 visualization reveals that the political leaning of 1st and 9th districts has changed from Democratic party to Republican party. Additionally, 4th congressional district has changed from Republican party to Democratic party.\nThe second representation of the data offers a detailed description of election outcomes by voting type from 2012 to 2022, distinguishing between victories and defeats through color-coded bars and labeled percentages. The analysis of Arizona’s electoral data over the past decade shows varying success rates for conventional voting methods, with a significant decline in 2020 followed by a notable recovery in 2022. In contrast, candidates utilizing write-in approaches consistently faced electoral setbacks year after year. This highlights the ongoing difficulty write-in candidates face in gaining political success in Arizona, despite traditional voting procedures maintaining dominance. These visual representations provide valuable insights into evolving political dynamics and voter preferences within the state."

    "text": "Analysis plan\nFor Question 1:\nIntroduction:\nusing the election data of 2016-2020 presidential term, we aim to filter the data for the most recent or a specific year of interest.Then to determine the wining party for each state by calculating the total votes as the winner. Finally, we create a a map of the USA is created to visualize the political landscape, coloring each state based on the wining party.\nVariables Involved:\n\nstate_po: The two-letter postal abbreviation for the state.\nparty: The political party of the candidate.\nyear: Year of the election, focusing on the most recent general election or a specific year of interest.\ncandidatevotes: The number of votes the candidate received.\n\nAnalysis Approach:\n\nFilter Data: Data selection from the general elections (stage variable) for the most recent year or a specific year of interest. The analysis focuses on data from the general elections for the most recent year or a specific year of interest within the 2016-2020 presidential term. This data includes information such as the two-letter postal abbreviation for each state (state_po), the political party of the candidate (party), the year of the election (year), and the number of votes each candidate received (candidatevotes).\nDetermine Winners: For each state, the analysis identifies the party with the highest aggregate candidate votes in the general election. This involves summing up the candidate votes for each party within each state and selecting the party with the highest total votes as the winner for that state.\nVisualization: Create a map of the USA, coloring each state based on the winning party. This visualization provides a clear depiction of the political landscape across the states for the selected election year, highlighting which party won each state.\n\nFor Question 2:\nIntroduction:\nBy merging the population data with existing election data to analyze how type of voting vary according to the population size in congressional districts. Using statistical approach to identify relationships between population and voting type, and also to determine which party tends to loose under certain conditions.\nVariables Involved:\n\ndistrict: The congressional district number.\nrunoff : second election held to determine a winner\nspecial : Special election\nparty: The political party of the candidate.\nyear: Year of the election, focusing on the most recent general election or a specific year of interest.\ncandidatevotes: The number of votes the candidate received.\ncandidate: Name of candidate\ntotalvotes: Total Votes in District\n\nVariables to be Created:\n\npopulation: This will require merging external data containing population\n\nAnalysis Approach:\n\nMerge External Data: The first step involves incorporating population data from a reliable source, such as the U.S. Census Bureau. This additional dataset will provide information on the population within each congressional district, which is essential for analyzing the relationship between population and voting type.\nHandling missing data or NA values: The dataset has various missing data points and NA values where data was either unable to be gathered, or there is simply no available data. To handle missing and NA values in discrete data, we as interpolation or imputation is not possible. For continuous data that is missing or NA, we will use mid-points, interpolation, or imputation to replace missing values. In the case that a row has missing continuous and discrete data, we will default to the rules we established for discrete data and remove the row entirely.\nMerge External Data: The first step involves incorporating population data from a reliable source, such as the U.S. Census Bureau. This additional dataset will provide information on the population within each congressional district, which is essential for analyzing the relationship between population and voting type.\nAnalyze Voting Type by Population: Examine the relationship between population and the type of voting, using statistical analysis .how the type of voting (e.g., fusion ticket, runoff, special elections) varies with population size. This analysis could involve methods such as regression analysis, chi-square tests, or other appropriate statistical techniques to identify any significant relationships or patterns.\ni. Statistical analysis techniques:\n\nRegression Analysis: We plan to use Logistic Regression to predict the probability of a party winning in a district based on variables such as population size, type of voting (e.g., fusion ticket, runoff, special elections), and demographic factors. Logistic regression is chosen because the outcome variable (win/lose) is binary. We will also explore Multiple linear regression models to understand the relationship between the number of votes received (continuous outcome variable) and predictors like population density and election type.\nChi-Square Tests: Chi-square tests will be utilized to examine the association between categorical variables, such as the presence of a fusion ticket and the winning party. This will help us identify if the distribution of election outcomes differs significantly across categories like election type (general, runoff, special) or district characteristics.\nTime-Series Analysis: For a longitudinal examination of voting trends, we will implement time-series analysis to assess changes over multiple election cycles. This includes using ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) , Exponential smoothing models to forecast voting patterns based on historical data. Additionally, Holt-Winters Seasonal Method , Time-series decomposition will also be employed to identify seasonal effects, trends, and residuals in voting behaviors, which can be correlated with major political or social events.\n\nii. Structured Comparative Analysis Over Time\nTo systematically address changes in US voting trends over time, our approach will include:\n\nSegmented Time-Series Analysis: We will divide the dataset into distinct time segments based on significant political or social milestones (e.g., changes in administration, major legislative changes, social movements). This will allow us to compare voting patterns before and after these events, providing insights into their impact on electoral outcomes.\nCross-Election Cycle Comparison: By comparing data across different election cycles, we aim to identify shifts in voter preferences, party dominance, and the effectiveness of various campaign strategies. This comparison will be visualized through line graphs and heat maps to illustrate trends and deviations over time.\nInteraction Effects in Regression Models: To understand the complex interplay between different factors influencing voting trends, we will include interaction terms in our regression models. This will help us examine how the impact of one variable (e.g., population size) on voting outcomes might change under different conditions (e.g., during special elections versus general elections).\n\nCorrelate with Election Outcomes: Focusing on which party tends to loose with certain characteristics.the next step is to assess how these factors correlate with election outcomes. Specifically, the focus will be on understanding which party tends to lose under certain conditions.\n\nVisualization and Reporting:\n\nUse scatter plots or heat maps to show the relationship between population and mode of voting.\nCreate comparative visualizations to illustrate how these factors influence election outcomes, potentially using bar charts and pie chart\n\nLIMITATIONS:\nLimited Demographic Data: Obtaining and processing extensive demographic data spanning 47 years pose significant challenges. As a result, only basic demographic information such as population size is included in the analysis. Detailed demographic variables like age, race, and income level is not included due to data availability constraints.\nLimited Economic and Social Data: Similarly, accessing economic indicators, education levels, and other social factors at the district level for a 47-year period could also be challenging and so we are not including that in the analysis too"
