This visualization will clearly depict the political landscape across the states for the selected election year.\n\nFor Question 2:\nVariables Involved:\n\ndistrict: The congressional district number.\nfusion ticket : allowing candidate to receive votes from multiple party.\nrunoff : second election held to determine a winner\nspecial : Special election\nparty: The political party of the candidate.\nyear: Year of the election, focusing on the most recent general election or a specific year of interest.\ncandidatevotes: The number of votes the candidate received.\ncandidate: Name of candidate\ntotalvotes: Total Votes in District\n\nVariables to be Created:\n\npopulation: This will require merging external data containing population\n\nAnalysis Approach:\n\nMerge External Data: The first step involves incorporating population data from a reliable source, such as the U.S. Census Bureau. This additional dataset will provide information on the population within each congressional district, which is essential for analyzing the relationship between population and voting type.\nAnalyze Voting Type by Population: Examine the relationship between population and the type of voting, using statistical analysis .how the type of voting (e.g., fusion ticket, runoff, special elections) varies with population size. This analysis could involve methods such as regression analysis, chi-square tests, or other appropriate statistical techniques to identify any significant relationships or patterns.\nCorrelate with Election Outcomes: Focusing on which party tends to loose with certain characteristics.the next step is to assess how these factors correlate with election outcomes. Specifically, the focus will be on understanding which party tends to lose under certain conditions.\n\nVisualization and Reporting:\n\nUse scatter plots or heat maps to show the relationship between population and mode of voting.\nCreate comparative visualizations to illustrate how these factors influence election outcomes, potentially using bar charts and pie chart"
