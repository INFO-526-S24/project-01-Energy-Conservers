# US House Election Dataset

## Understanding the Dataset
-   Data sourced from MIT Election Data and Science Lab

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
-   Contains observations from elections in the House of Representatives over a span of 47 years starting in 1976 all the way up to 2022 and encompasses a total of 32,452 recorded events. Each event is represented with 20 attributes.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
-   For our analysis some of the most important variables will be:

    ::: columns
    ::: {.column width="33%"}
    **`year`**
    :::

    ::: {.column width="33%"}
    **`party`**
    :::

    ::: {.column width="34%"}
    **`state_po`**
    :::

    ::: {.column width="33%"}
    **`population`**
    :::
    
    ::: {.column width="33%"}
    **`totalvotes`**
    :::
    
    ::: {.column width="34%"}
    **`district`**

## Question 1 {auto-animate=true}

::: {style="margin-top: 0px;"}
Election Results
:::
How did US voting trends change election results throughout the 2016-2020 presidential term?

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
### Analysis
To answer this question we will look at which party won in each state for the years 2016, 2018, and 2020 to identify patterns and significant changes that occurred in the election results.

## Insight
-   The sentiment of the general population is often overlooked by the electoral system
-   The sentiment of people during a single presidency will change significantly
-   Evident trends can be seen such as supporting the opposite party of the current president in midterm elections

## Question 2
How is the type of voting influenced by population and how does that influence who loses?
